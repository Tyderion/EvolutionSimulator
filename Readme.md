# Evolution Simulator

Code was originally developed by carykh [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9z7EZAbkphEMg0SP7rw44A).
He released it in the following video: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N7NYc7PPf8&t=1502s)

This repository here is a try to organize the code and make it run within intelliJ so that developing and changing it will be more fun for people who don't know the code yet.

To Use:
Simply clone and open in IntelliJ. Then run the only existing main method to start the Simulator.
